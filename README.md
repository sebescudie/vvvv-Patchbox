vvvv-Patchbox
=================

This pack is a collection of patching tools and techniques for [vvvv](http://vvvv.org/).

It emerged from different needs to cope with the somewhat ancient GUI of vvvv and the will to improve upon it.

If you have questions or want to share an idea just head over to the vvvv contribution page.
